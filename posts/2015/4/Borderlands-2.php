   							sequel to it's predecessor from years before. Using nVidia physX 
   							Borderlands 2 takes the cake with some awesome, and sometimes disturbing 
   							scenes that will leave you in awe. With a vast array of thousands 
   							of millions of weapons, characters that make you wonder if anyone 
   							on Pandora is truly sane, and missions that make you question life 
   							(not really) there's not much to dislike from this game.";
   	$pageInfo[text] = "Though I personally haven't completed the game due to lack of accompaniment 
   							(a.k.a. forever alone) I still have a great respect for the game. 
   							I've been a fan of the Borderlands series since I played the original 
   							Borderlands game about a year ago. I enjoyed it and played it for hours, 
   							but even through all that time the plot didn't really get me as 
   							intranced as it's sequel. Borderlands 2 has a plot that will keep 
   							you wondering what will happen next, and with a villian that is almost 
   							impossible to resist laughing at. Hansom Jack truly is the real hero 
   							of Pandora. Or not.
   						</br></br>
   							I'll try and update this as soon as possible in another post, but I 
   							felt like at least some introduction was in order.";
