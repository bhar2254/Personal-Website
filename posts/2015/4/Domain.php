   						use the very long and boring string of numbers that they used to get 
   						here. I'll explain once you open the full post.";

   						you use to host the site and what the site url is that you choose. Now, 
   						for a normal person a $12/year fee wouldn't seem to bad, unless you 
   						have no credit/debit card. I am in this position. I don't have any 
   						form of internet money, and that makes it very difficult for me to 
   						be able to purchase a domain. That means that until I can find money 
   						everyone will have to use this IP.
