   							I've spent quite some time and effort (most of today) working

   							my bum to keep this updated and to continue making it better and better.

   							(today depending on how when you decide the day starts) was the 
   							integration with multiple social sources (e.g. Twitter and Google+) 
   							trying to make this more usable. I've even added comments. Feel 
   							free to comment on this. Do it. C'mon guys.";
