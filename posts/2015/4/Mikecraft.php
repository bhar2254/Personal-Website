   							most of the work that was done in either a week or so. I've 
   							modified almost every line of code and added hundreds more, but 
   							that's not the end of it.";
   	$pageInfo[text] = "If you're interested in the way the game works you can check me out on 
   							GitHub (bhar2254) if not then you could just download the game from 
   							the Mikecraft page on this webstie. I will now begin to talk up 
   							my game and make everyone understand how amazing this game truly is.
   						</br></br>
   							Mikecraft was designed to be an easy to play two dimensional 
   							platformer game that anyone with two brain cells to knock together 
   							could play. You, as a player, take control of the mild-mannered robot 
   							named William, and you go through a fictional world of poor resolution 
   							textures in order to escape whoever or whatever put you there.
   						</br></br>
   							Throughout the game you will incounter objects like holes in the 
   							ground, and the vicious ball-throwing menace, Mike, for whom the 
   							game was named after.
   						</br></br>
   							Feel free to take a look at Mikecraft <a href=/mikecraft.php>here</a>.";
