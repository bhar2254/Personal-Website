						the information on the projects and added download links to the 
						free/open-source applications and to their GitHub pages.";

						applications that I've made. These include Ultimate Pong and Mikecraft. 
						Both of these games are free to download and free to play, I just ask 
						that if you do share these games make sure to give me credit, and 
						don't share these games on your own site without a link to my page. 
						I've spent quite some time honing my java skills and designing these 
						games. I'll try update their pages on this website and keep them up 
						to date as well as adding information about these programs such as 
						features and future updates that I am planning and bug fixes for anyone 
						who is curious.
					</br></br>
						Feel free to check me out on <a href=https://github.com/bhar2254>GitHub</a> 
						for the source code for these games and for special updates and pre-releases 
						for games that won't be released on this site.
					</br></br>
						UPDATE: It is now taking longer for me to load the web page than to modify 
						webpage. So much waiting, I may take a break.	";
