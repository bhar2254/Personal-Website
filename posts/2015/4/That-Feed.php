   							and you can check out my personal version of this site. It's still 
   							behind this site in terms of updating because I use this one 
   							to test it, simply because Red Hat is a vast amount easier to use 
   							than my own personal Ubuntu server. Check it out.
   						</br></br>UPDATE: I've also added a Goggle Comments widget. Feel free 
   							to comment on a page, but if you comment profanity I will remove 
   							the comments. Don't be stupid.";
